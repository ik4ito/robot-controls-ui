*simple 5 buttons interface that uses MySQL to record inputted data*

This HTML UI uses PHP to forward the input to a MySQL database
in these files I uploaded the Database is ***directions*** and
the table is ***input***.
You can modify the files to whatever database name(and/or login credentials) you want,
simply modify the html file to target your php file and in the php
file just point at whatever name, password, user, your database has.
